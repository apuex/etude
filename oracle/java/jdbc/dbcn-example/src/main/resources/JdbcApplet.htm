<h1>JDBC applet</h1>

This page contains an example of an applet that uses the Thin JDBC
driver to connect to Oracle.<p>

The source code for the applet is in <a
href="JdbcApplet.java">JdbcApplet.java</a>.  Please check carefully
the driver class name and the connect string in the code.<p>

The Applet tag in this file contains a CODEBASE entry that must be set
to point to a directory containing the Java classes from the Thin JDBC
distribution *and* the compiled JdbcApplet.class.<p>

As distributed it will *not* work because the ojdbc5.jar are not
in this directory.<p>
